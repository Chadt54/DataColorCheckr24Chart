# SpyderX's Color Checkr24 Chart
The digital version of SpyderX's color chart that comes with the SpyderX Photo Kit.

I wanted something like this image, with correct colors, but couldn't find it anywhere on the DataColor website, or anywhere online, so I created one myself. 

In Krita (version 4.4.1), the colors will appear wrong if you don't set your display .icc profile to the profile created with your SpyderX device. To do this, go to "Settings>Configure Krita...>Color Management>Display> Screen #" and set it to your newly created profile.

This image is based off of this document (The values from the sRGB column were used (not the Adobe RGB or Lab columns)): [SpyderCheckr_Color_Data_V2.pdf](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/uploaded_files/321850/SpyderCheckr_Color_Data_V2.pdf)

The spreadsheet is based off of this page (but I fixed some typos that the website had, so my spreadsheet should be more accurate than this web page): [Color Definitions](https://www.bartneck.de/2017/10/24/patch-color-definitions-for-datacolor-spydercheckr-48/)

Use at your own risk.
